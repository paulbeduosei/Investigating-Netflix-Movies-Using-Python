# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-Using-Python
Wrapped up a super fun exploratory data analysis project digging into Netflix movies from the 1990s 📼🎞️

What started as a simple trip down memory lane turned into a full deep dive into runtime trends, genre distributions, and release patterns from one of the greatest decades in film. Using Python and the netflix_data.csv dataset, I analyzed what defined the 90s movie era and explored how those titles show up on Netflix today.

As someone who loves combining nostalgia with data, this project was the perfect excuse to flex my EDA skills while revisiting classics from a decade full of iconic storytelling.
